          A combination of 4 colored pegs is generated randomly at the beginning
          of the game.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The user must guess the combination generated by placing pegs on the
          board. In this case, you have to click the buttons to change their
          color.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination must be guessed in ten turns, else the game is over.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When the guess is submitted, hints appear on the right side of the
          board.
        </p>
        <p>Pegs are placed randomly in the square :</p>
        <p>
          - a white peg indicates that a peg has the right color but the wrong
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          - a red peg indicates that one of the pegs has both the right color
          and the right position.
